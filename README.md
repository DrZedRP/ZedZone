# Dr.Zed's ZedZone

This mod is heavily WIP and not in any release state yet, but if someone still wants to take a look at it feel free to do so.

An example on how to spawn the zones can be found within the mission's init.c

## (Planned) Features Pre-release

  - 5 different "GasZones" from VERYLOW to VERYHIGH.
  - Visual identification as soon as you enter the zone/increasing effect depending on ZoneLevel
  - "Damage over Time" while you are within the zone
  - Damage mitigation based on "MASK"-slot e.g. GP5GasMask, NioshFaceMask (respirator)
  - Zone Sickness to prevent camping (not yet)
  - Zone Debuff to prevent hopping in and out (not yet)
  - random events/zone spawn (not yet)
